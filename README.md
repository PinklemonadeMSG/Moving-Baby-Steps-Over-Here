Relearning everything and truly understanding 
This is my journal to relearn everything I did not know about Linux and Windows.
My setup is a lab I built from help from online sources; it is a Raspberry Pi 4 with enough storage. My idea is to set up a vmware Windows and Linux server ? 
Then have a practical project to apply and develop those learned skills.
