# Moving-Baby-Steps-Over-Here

Relearning everything and truly understanding the things I thought I knew...
This is my personal and learning journal to relearn everything I did not know about Linux and Windows (which is everything noone can know everything. I will always be ignorant about some topic; I know how to admit what I don't know and research to fill that gap.

My setup is a lab I'm building with help from online sources; it is a Raspberry Pi 4 with enough storage that is connected to an old laptop screen using a hdmi to usb and a lcd controller for the screen. My idea is to set up a vmware Windows and Linux server ? 
Then have a practical project to apply and develop those learned skills. 

Skip to the *Anyway section to skip my intro in each daily log.
