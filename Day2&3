Yesterday I played the bandit war games levels 0-2 .
These war games are a great way to reinforce learning command on linux
I know my learning style and it's better for me to pace myself than to rush in and try to memorize the material without actually learning.
linux already has ssh I remember using cygwin once for windows 
Commands learned from yesterday 2/4/2022

-p for the port 
username@server 


< 
./


The order in which you type the commands matter

ToDo:
play bandit levels 3-7
Read  about building a LAMP (Python not PHP)
